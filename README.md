Inspiration

We were inspired by the language barrier that disallows many people from getting a job. With our app we hope to create an outlet to creating future agricultural jobs for people that may not speak the same language as majority of the people in country they are in.

What it does

AR app that scans different fruits and vegetables, and identifies and defines them in selected languages. We have 2 main targets/purposes; Gardeners-Training: Gardners are able to train employees that may not be able to speak English with our app. Gardeners are able to train current employees to become bilingual in their job. Education-Learning: People can interactively learn different fruits and vegetables in multiple languages.

How we built it

First, we collected data of different fruits and vegetables, their name, and definition and found those names and definitions in various languages such as English, French, Japanese and Spanish. With the data collected we then stored it into a firebase database, and wrote some code to connect it to our app. We then created a camera button, which allows the user to use their phone camera to scan. Then we created a list Picker control, consisting of multiple languages, that the user can easily select from. From there we were able to fully prototype our app with the help of another AR application.

Challenges we ran into

We had a challenging start in getting our firebase to connect directly to our app, as our data had been scattered.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud of successfully creating a functional camera button, as well as being able to fully prototype our app.

What we learned

We learned more about the Swift language overall as well as its UI kits. We learned how to successfully create a functional camera button, as well as a list picker.

What's next for International Gardener

We hope to add even more languages to our app, as well as possibly converting it into VR, for better training.
